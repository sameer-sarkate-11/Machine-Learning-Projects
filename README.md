# Machine-Learning-Projects

The repository contains the following projects:

HR Attrition: This project uses a dataset of employee attributes to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not. The model is trained using a combination of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The dataset is available in the HR_Employee_Attrition_Data.csv file.

Bankruptcy: This project uses a dataset of financial attributes to predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not. The model is trained using a combination of machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. The dataset is available in the BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION .csv file.

Spotify Song Clustering: This project uses a dataset of song attributes to cluster songs based on their characteristics. The model is trained using a combination of machine learning algorithms, including k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. The dataset is available in the playlists.csv and genre.csv file.

Airway Clustering: This project uses a dataset of airway attributes to cluster airways based on their characteristics. The model is trained using a combination of machine learning algorithms, including k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering. The dataset is available in the train.csv and test.csv file.

These projects demonstrate various techniques and algorithms in data analysis and modeling, and can be used as a starting point for further exploration and development.
